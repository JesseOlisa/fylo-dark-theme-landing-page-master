## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript



### What I learned

I learnt how to manipulate background images using CSS to fit into different screensizes.

I learn how to use javascript to value form
```js
 if (email.value.trim() === '') {
        errormsg(error, 'Please enter a valid email address');
        email.placeholder = 'johnappleseed#mail.com';
    }
    else {
        removeErrorMsg(error);
    }
```
The johnappleseed stuff is just there to march the figma design
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



### Continued development

I want to learn more about validating form using javascript. Maybe try out forms that are more complex.



### Useful resources

- The Internet: I did a lot of research to achieve this project. It's hard to even keep track.
